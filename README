The first implementaion of a wait free counter in C++.

To run:make clean;make

Progress Guarantee:
1.In node:
    1.1 index-id of thread for which counter has been incremeneted.Can be incremeneted by another thread in help
    1.2 state-in which function incremenet takes place("increment" or "help")

2.in help(double)
    2.1 line 35-when t1 performs CAS successfully on counter but does not perform CAS of platform[i] yet,thread t2 will check that index i has already been helped,so t2 will not help it further

3.in WFIncrement(int)
    3.1 line 35-43: t1 and t2 want to help index i,say t1 performs CAS successfully on counter but does not perform CAS on platform[i] yet.In this gap,thread t3 increments counter in WFIncrement() and now counter.state=="increment",t2 will pass if condition in line 35 and perform a double increment(first  increment performed by t1).Hence t3 will check if index i has been helped but platform[i] != null,then t3 will set platform[i] as null and proceed to increment.
